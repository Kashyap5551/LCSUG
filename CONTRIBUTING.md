# Contributing to LCSUG
Thank you for considering contributing to the project. While I can't guarantee your PR will be merged, I'm open to reviewing any changes that will improve the LCSUG! :rocket:

## What can I work on?
Generally speaking, I care more about **content** than **design**. Most things I need help for (i.e. course descriptions) will be posted in the
[issues board](https://github.com/chrisngyn/LCSUG/issues). If there's something you think is worth adding and it's not on the board, please open
an issue for it so I can review it.
  
I'm finicky about the website layout, so if you spend hours changing the website's design, **I can't promise I will merge it**.  
  
If there's anything you want to discuss, my Discord is **@chrispy#8933**. :wave:
