## About
This is my take on a guide to Computer Science at York University. This guide is intended to document all the things I learned over the years, answer frequently asked questions, and write all the things that I wish I knew when I was a first year student.  

I was heavily inspired by seeing students from other universities make guides for their respective program, so I wanted to do something similar and give back to the community. :heart:

## Contributing
Make sure you read CONTRIBUTING.md.  

In essence, I'll be posting issues overtime about things I need help with (i.e. missing course descriptions, requests for visual appearance updates, and more). If there's something not listed that you want to see added, make an issue or add me on Discord, **@chrispy#8933**. I'm open to accepting any PRs that will improve the LCSUG.
