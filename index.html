                  <p class="coursetext">
                    This course is about some of the possible research topics in the realm of computer science. The topics and lectures vary every year. If you want to go into research
                    in the futre, you'll enjoy this class.<br><br>
                    This is definitely the easiest course you'll ever take. It's pass or fail, so no grade is received. To pass, you just need to attend the classes and do the
                    quizzes that are at the end of every lecture, with the occasional assignment strewn throughout the course.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - easiest course in the degree. You'll have a good time.</p>

                  <strong>Introduction to Computing: A Net-centric Approach</strong><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    This is an introductory programming course. You'll learn the fundamentals, such as what variables are, beginner programming logic (conditional logic, loops, program tracing), and
                    the basics of web development.<br><br>
                    You'll be working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. If you did any programming on your own / in high school, this will be a walk in the park. If you didn't, you can
                    still end with a high grade as long as you put in the time and effort needed (which is minimal). This course is definitely on the easier side of the spectrum.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - if you're a first time programmer then make sure you learn and understand basics of programming, else, this will be easy for you.</p>

                  <strong>Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</strong><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    Discrete math is not like your average mathematics such as advanced functions or calculus. This is about the math that is related and necessary in computer science and includes topic
                    like logic, Boolean algebra, set theory, and more.<br><br>
                    I found the first half of this course to be pretty easy (logic, Boolean algebra, and set theory) but it definitely ramped up when we started doing proofs, induction, counting principles,
                    and more. This is a pretty abstract course and <i>can</i> be difficult to wrap your head around all the concepts, so some attention is needed.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - one of the more challenging first year courses with an easy first half with a harder second half. Don't take this with MATH1310.</p>

                    A more ramped up version of EECS1012. Instead of web development, you'll be making mobile apps using Java and Android Studio. This would be a good time to mention that Java is the
                    "main" language York teaches in; you'll have another 3-4 courses to take that uses Java.<br><br>
                    I found this course to be fun, although definitely more challenging. I remember having problems not only picking up Java for the first time, but also having to learn how to use the
                    Android Studio IDE. It's important to leave this course knowing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - if you've programmed before in any OOP language you'll be fine. Otherwise, take this course seriously and learn how to program in Java; we use it a lot.</p>

                    This is Calculus I - mainly derivatives with some integrals near the end. If you did well in calculus in high school, you'll find majority of this course content to be similar, with
                    the newer content not being that much more challenging.<br><br>
                    If you struggled with calculus in high school, you'll most likely struggle here too. Read the textbook; it really helped in my opinion. I also used

                    This is Calculus II - which is entirely about integrals. If you found calculus I to be easy, don't think that this course is anything like it. There is an insane ramp in difficulty
                    between these two courses and a lot of difficult content. I recommend you pay a lot of attention and follow the textbook closely.
                    <a class="special-link" href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/CalcII.aspx" target="_blank">This</a> website helped a lot.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - I hope you're good with integrals. I would say this is one of the hardest first year courses, and recommend not doing this with EECS1019.</p>

                    You need to take 6.00 credits in sciences from a list of courses. Typically this means either two biology, two chemistry, one biology and one chemistry,
                    or one physics course (biology and chemistry courses are 3.00 credits while physics is a 6.00 credit).<br><br>
                    I went with two chemistries (CHEM1000, CHEM1001) since I excelled in it in high school. Play to your strengths and what you did well in during high school.</p><br>

                    You need 90 credits for the regular degree, and 120 credits for the honours degree. The computer Science, science, and mathematics requirement don't fill the requirement
                    itself, so you'll be taking electives here and there. Generally, I advise against taking electives in first year unless you <i>know</i> you can handle it. I took my first year
                    easy to gauge how I'd handle university life, and didn't take any electives.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - I advise against taking an elective in your first year since you should use it to gauge how difficult you find university and to set good habits,
                    but electives I've taken and really enjoyed are MODR1770, GEOG2030, HUMA2220, and STS2411.</p>

                  My friends and I joke about this course a lot. We nicknamed this course, "The Gatekeeper" course because it holds people back from graduation. It's less on the difficulty scale, but
                  it's just SO MUCH WORK. My friend spent the entire winter reading week doing one lab and he still got a 30% on it.<br><br>

                    Jokes on you. There is no "4th year core". This is when you choose your own 4th year courses and decide what you are interested in and want to specialize in further.
                    There is mandatory 4th year courses to take, but you need to have at least 12.0 credits of EECS4XXX courses.</p>

            This course is about possible research topics in the field of Computer Science. The topics and lectures vary every year.<br><br>
            This is definitely the easiest course you'll ever do, and it's pass or fail (no grade received). As long as you attend the classes, do the quizzes at the end
            of each lecture, and remember to do the assignments - you'll be fine.<br><br>
            tl;dr - easiest course of your degree. You'll have a good time.

          Hi!<br><br>
          My name is Christopher. I'm a third year Computer Science Honours student at Lassonde with the intention of dropping out to do the regular B.Sc degree.
          If you want to know why I won't be doing my Honours, I answer that in FAQ.<br><br>
          I was the Computing Students' Hub president from 2019-2020, and a lot of people would reach out to me with a lot of questions and I wanted to put together
          this website as a way to document everything I wish I knew coming into univeristy, answering a lot of common questions, and more.<br><br>
          If you're reading this, then thank you for taking the time to browse through this website. I hope that it was of some assistance to you! If there are any inconsistencies,
          something outdated, or want a topic added, feel free to message me on Discord, @beepo#8933.
