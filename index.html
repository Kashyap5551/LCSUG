                    This course is about some of the possible research topics in the realm of Computer Science. The topics and lectures vary every year.<br><br>
                    This is definitely the easiest course you'll ever do, and it's pass or fail (no grade received). As long as you attend the classes, do the quizzes at the end
                    of each lecture, and remember to do the assignments - you'll be fine.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">

                  <strong>Introduction to Computing: A Net-centric Approach</strong><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    This is an introductory course to Computer Science. You'll learn the fundamentals of programming - what variables are, beginner programming logic (conditional logic, loops, program tracing), and
                    the basics of web development.<br><br>
                    You'll be working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. If you did any programming on your own or in high school,
                    you'll find this to be a walk in the park. If you didn't, you can still end with a high grade as long as you put in the time and effort; this course is definitely
                    on the easier side of the spectrum.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - if you've programmed before, this'll be easy. If this is your first taste of programming, make sure you learn and understand the concepts.</p>

                  <strong>Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</strong><br>
                  Discrete math is not like your average mathematics such as advanced functions or calculus, with formulas and calculations. This is about the math that is related and necessary
                  for Computer Science. It's how computers think.<br><br>
                  I found the first half of this course to be pretty easy; it was basic logic, logical operators, and set theory. It definitely ramped up a lot when we started doing
                  proofs, induction, counting principles, and more. This is a pretty abstract course and can be difficult to wrap your head around all the concepts, so actually try to pay attention.
                  This is a pretty useful course, I learned a lot and it's really important in being a good developer.<br><br>
                  tl;dr - one of the more challenging first year courses for sure. Make sure you put a lot of time and effort into this.

                  <strong>Programming for Mobile Computing</strong><br>
                  Definitely a more ramped up and harder course than EECS1012. You'll be learning how to make mobile applications using Java and Android Studio. This would be
                  a good time to mention that Java is the "main" language York University uses; you have another 3-4 courses to take in Java.<br><br>
                  I found this course to be fun - you get to see your code come to fruition and see something real being made from it. That being said, I thought this course
                  was challenging because you're not just learning how to program in a new language, you also have to learn how to use the Android Studio IDE. I actually came
                  into university having never written a single line of code before, so I thought this was hard. I went from an A in EECS1012, to a C in EECS1022.<br><br>
                  tl;dr - if you've programmed before you'll be good. Otherwise, take this course seriously. Learn how to program in Java; we use it a lot.

                  <strong>Differential Calculus with Applications</strong><br>
                  This is Calculus I, a lot of differentials and a bit of integrals near the end. If you did well in calculus in high school, this will be a breeze for you because
                  almost half of this course is high school content, with the other half being new content that isn't that much more challenging.<br><br>
                  If you struggled with calculus in high school, you'll definitely struggle here too. Read the textbook, pay attention in lectures, and ask for help.<br><br>
                  tl;dr - good at high school calculus? Good. No? Work hard.

                  <strong>Integral Calculus with Applications</strong><br>
                  This is Calculus II, all about integrals. If you found calculus I to be easy, don't think that this course is anything like it. There is an INSANE ramp up from
                  calculus I to calculus II. I failed this course once before I got my credits in this class, and even then it was tough despite me having already taken it.<br><br>
                  I highly recommend you pay the utmost attention in these lectures and follow the textbook very closely.<br><br>
                  tl;dr - I would say this is one of the hardest first year courses to take. Manage your time well and try not to take this course with other difficult courses.

                  <strong>Foundational Science Requirement</strong><br>
                  You need to take 6.00 credits in foundational sciences from a list of courses. Typically this means either two biology, two chemistry, one biology and one chemistry,
                  or one physics course (biology and chemistry courses are 3.00 credits while physics is a 6.00 credit).<br><br>
                  Personally, I went with two chemistry courses since I excelled in these courses in high school. I walked away with an A in both CHEM1000 and CHEM1001, but remember to
                  play to your strength and what you did well in during high school.<br><br>
                  tl;dr - I can't speak for biology or physics, but I went with the chemistry route and found it enjoyable.

                  <strong>Electives</strong><br>
                  Remember that you need 120 credits to get your degree. The computer science, science, and mathematics requirement don't fill the 120 itself, so you'll be taking a few
                  electives here and there. Generally, I advise against electives in first year unless you know you can handle it. Personally, I was pretty worried for my first year of
                  university and took it easy just to gauge how I'd handle the university life.<br><br>
                  tl;dr - this is up to you and if you feel like you can handle adding an elective to your course load.

                  My friends and I joke about this course a lot. We nicknamed this course, "The Gatekeeper" course because it holds people back from graduation. It's less on the difficulty scale, but
                  it's just SO MUCH WORK. My friend spent the entire winter reading week doing one lab and he still got a 30% on it.<br><br>

                  Jokes on you. There is no "4th year core". This is when you choose your own 4th year courses and decide what you are interested in and want to specialize in further.
                  There is mandatory 4th year courses to take, but you need to have at least 12.0 credits of EECS4XXX courses.

        <p>
          Hi!<br><br>
          My name is Christopher. I'm a third year Computer Science Honours student at Lassonde with the intention of dropping out to do the regular B.Sc degree.
          If you want to know why I won't be doing my Honours, I answer that in FAQ.<br><br>
          I was the Computing Students' Hub president from 2019-2020, and a lot of people would reach out to me with a lot of questions and I wanted to put together
          this website as a way to document everything I wish I knew coming into univeristy, answering a lot of common questions, and more.<br><br>
          If you're reading this, then thank you for taking the time to browse through this website. I hope that it was of some assistance to you! If there are any inconsistencies,
          something outdated, or want a topic added, feel free to message me on Discord, @beepo#8933.
