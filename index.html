                  <p class="coursetext">
                    This course is about some of the possible research topics in the realm of computer science. The topics and lectures vary every year. If you want to go
                    into research in the future, you'll enjoy this class.<br><br>
                    This is definitely the easiest course you'll ever take. It's pass or fail, so no grade is received. To pass, you just need to attend the classes and
                    do the quizzes that are at the end of every lecture, with the occasional assignment strewn throughout the course.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - easiest course in the degree. You'll have a good time.</p>

                  <p class="coursetext">
                    This is an introductory programming course. You'll learn the fundamentals, such as what variables are, beginner programming logic (conditional logic,
                    loops, program tracing), and the basics of web development.<br><br>
                    You'll be working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. If you did any programming on your own / in high school, this will be a walk in the park.
                    If you didn't, you can still end with a high grade as long as you put in the time and effort needed (which is minimal). This course is definitely on the
                    easier side of the spectrum.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - if you're a first time programmer then make sure you learn and understand basics of programming, else, this will be easy for you.</p>

                  <p class="coursetext">
                    Discrete math is not like your average mathematics such as advanced functions or calculus. This is about the math that is related and necessary in computer
                    science and includes topic like logic, Boolean algebra, set theory, and more.<br><br>
                    I found the first half of this course to be pretty easy (logic, Boolean algebra, and set theory) but it definitely ramped up when we started doing proofs, induction,
                    counting principles, and more. This is a pretty abstract course and <i>can</i> be difficult to wrap your head around all the concepts, so some attention is needed.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - one of the more challenging first year courses with an easy first half with a harder second half. Don't take this with MATH1310.</p>

                    A more ramped up version of EECS1012. Instead of web development, you'll be making mobile apps using Java and Android Studio. This would be a good time to mention that Java
                    is the "main" language York teaches in; you'll have another 3-4 courses to take that uses Java.<br><br>
                    I found this course to be fun, although definitely more challenging. I remember having problems not only picking up Java for the first time, but also having to learn how
                    to use the Android Studio IDE. It's important to leave this course knowing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - if you've programmed before in any OOP language you'll be fine. Otherwise, take this course seriously and learn how to program in Java; we use it a lot.</p>

                    in difficulty between these two courses and a lot of difficult content. I recommend you pay a lot of attention and follow the textbook closely.

                    You need to take 6.00 credits in sciences from a list of courses. Typically this means either two biology, two chemistry, one biology and one chemistry,
                    or one physics course (biology and chemistry courses are 3.00 credits while physics is a 6.00 credit).<br><br>
                    I went with two chemistries (CHEM1000, CHEM1001) since I excelled in it in high school. Play to your strengths and what you did well in during high school.</p><br>

                    This course is intense on computing theory, and includes topics like automata theory, Turing machines, formal languages, and more. If these words don't make sense to
                    you, it didn't make sense to me either. This is really abstract and a theory heavy course, and I found this to be my least favourite second year course. It did have
                    its moments when it was really interesting, but it was also mostly hard and perplexing. Definitely urge you to pay attention in your lectures.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">

                  <p class="coursetext">
                    Arguably the <strong>most important second year course</strong> alongside EECS2030. It's important to master data structures because these concepts, alongside
                    algorithms, is what you area tested on in your programming interviews. I definitely got carefree the first time I took this course and ended with a D, but I took
                    it again and got a A. Easy beginning, but definitely ramps up once you start trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - take this course seriously! Make sure you really, really, REALLY learn these concepts to a tee. Even after this course, keep practising and practising your
                    data structures. Go on HackerRank or LeetCode, and keep learning and refining your skills.</p>

                    Definitely a really unique course. While most people find this course annoying and useless, I actually found it interesting. You'll be learning about computer
                    architecture, and working with low-level assembly languages like RISC-V and Verilog. I still haven't used RISC-V or Verilog a day in my life since I took this course,
                    but it was still interesting to me nonetheless. Definitely has a heavy workload though, for sure.<br><br>
                    It's important to note that this is a <strong>4.00 credit</strong> course, so it weighs more heavily on your GPA than a 3.00 credit course would. If you're looking for an
                    opportunity to raise your GPA a bit, getting an A / A+ in this course would help.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - can't say I've found much practical use for this course in my life, but if you want to go into low-level programming work or engineering roles, maybe
                    this would help you more if you knew these languages well. Heavy workload, don't recommend taking this alongside EECS2011.</p>

                    The reason why I stress this is an important course is because this will ultimately help you to write better code as a developer. Plus, you'll be asked about OOP concepts in interviews.<br><br>
                    I enjoyed this course a lot, and it has a relatively lighter workload compared to other second year courses.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - important and fundamental course with a relatively light workload. Despite this, spend ample amount of time learning the concepts.</p>

                    Your first C course. I found this one to be a little challenging because I was so used to languages like Java and Python, and C was like new territory for me. You will spend a lot of time
                    learning C, but also how to use a bunch of Linux commands, Bash scripting, and more.<br><br>
                    Have you been using Windows or Mac your whole time to program? Well now you'll be programming in an environment called Linux. Have you gotten used to hitting "run" in Android Studio or Eclipse
                    when programming in Java? Well now you'll learn how to compile and run C programs in a terminal!</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - in my opinion a challenging course, but to others an easy one. Can't give a solid statement on this, but learn C ahead of time if you're worried about this class.</p>

                    The follow-up to EECS1019. I found this course to be a lot easier. It's still a lot of logic, but less on the mathematical side in terms of number theory, counting principles, set theory,
                    etcetera. It's more abstract, logical concepts instead and with a lot more proofs.</p><br>

                    I would consider this course to be the most important third year course. This one is all about algorithms, but not just that, <i>efficient</i> algorithms. Imagine you
                    had a program that executed in 10 minutes on an input of say, 100 size (arbitrary units). Imagine as you scale the input higher and highier, say to 1,000 and 10,000, then
                    your execution time would take significantly longer. Imagine you could write a more efficient program that executed 10x faster. That's why this course is important.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">

                    Oh boy...this course.<br><br>
                    My friends and I joke about this a lot. We nicknamed it, "The Gatekeeper" since it holds so many people back from graduation. It's less on the difficulty scale, but there's just an
                    insane amount of work, and the thing that sucks a lot, is you feel so demotivated because you can't figure out <i>why</i> you're doing this.<br><br>
                    Let me clarify. This course is about software design - how to structure and design your code properly so it's more efficient, readable, and more. But the thing is, York University
                    insists on using an ancient language called Eiffel. You're going to spend four months programming in this language just to never use it again, is what I've found. That's the reason I
                    personally felt so drained and demotivated - the concepts were important, but you aren't forced to just learn the concepts! You have to learn an entirely new language, which takes away
                    from the <i>primary</i> purpose of this course: to learn software design patterns.<br><br>
                    The material is important. The concepts are important. What you learn is important and will make you a better developer if you know how to apply them. But, it's just poor execution on
                    the school's part. Although, try your hardest in this course to scrape by. At the end of the day, make sure you walk away knowing what design patterns are, the common ones, and how to
                    implement them (in more modern languages too, like Java).</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - insanely difficult course. Not due to material, but the workload. Learning a new language, how to use the Eiffel Studio IDE, and all the theory is tough. Absolutely
                    do not take this course at the same time as EECS3101 or EECS3221, that would be a suicide mission.</p>

                    This is your choice between EECS3215 (Embedded Systems) or EECS3221 (Operating System Fundamentals). Although, you really don't have much of a choice. You're going to end up taking EECS3221.<br><br>
                    Why? By the time you take this course, you'll have all the prerequisites to take EECS3221. You will most likely never have the prerequisites done for EECS3215, because it needs EECS3201, which
                    needs EECS2200...etcetera. Courses you don't have to take, so you most likely never will.<br><br>
                    This course is about operating systems, and is another C course. This course has a pretty tough workload, so I suggest not doing it at the same time as EECS3101 or EECS3311, if it can be helped.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">

                    This is your choice between EECS3401 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence), EECS3421 (Introduction to Database Systems), or EECS3461 (User Interfaces). Unlike EECS3215 and EECS3221, you
                    actually get to choose here!<br><br>
                    So, I went with the EECS3421 route (databases). I really enjoyed it, found it extremely useful, and honestly I gained so much value from this course. As soon as this course was over, I went back
                    to a few of my personal projects and revamped them, incorporating them with a database and making them much more sophisicated. If you also take this course, you'll be learning topics like
                    relational algebra, SQL, ER diagrams, and more. Not all professors will cover this, but we went over SQL security and SQL injections, which was a lot of fun!<br><br>
                    Remember you aren't limited to taking only one of these options. You can do more from this list if you wanted. I can't speak on the other courses since I haven't taken them, but I can vouch
                    that databases was really useful, fun, and the workload was decent.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - I took EECS3421. Fun and important course to being a developer with a decent workload. Can't speak on the other two courses.</p>

                    And a lot more. I won't list all of them, but make sure you hound your Degree Progress Report (DPR) tool a lot and meet with academic advisors every so often to
                    stay on top of things and make sure you aren't missing any requirements.</p><br>
                  <p class="coursetext">
                    <strong>tl;dr</strong> - lots of requirements strewn across your degree. Check with academic advisors and the DPR tool regularly.</p>

            <strong>Staying Organized</strong><br>
            <p class="coursetext">
              It's pretty damn important you stay on top of your organization in university. Trust me. My first year was abysmal because I thought I could remember everything
              in my head or through the notes app on my phone.<br><br>
              Now, I keep a Google calendar to remind of all my lectures, labs, test, and exam dates. I had a physical notebook I used as a journal to keep tracking my current grades in
              classes, degree progress, and my professors e-mails. I use Discord a lot, so I made my own Discord server where I'm the only member and I use it a <strong>ton</strong> to
              remember important links, write quick reminders, track my degree progress, write down the requirements to courses I need to take in the future, and a lot more.<br><br>
              Please stay on top of your organization. It's an easy way to feel overwhelmed otherwise, having so much to remember and not being able to remember all of it, or knowing you wrote
              something down once and can't remember where you put that piece of paper.</p>

            <strong>Time Management</strong><br>
            <p class="coursetext">
              Knowing how to manage your time is a pivotal part in being a university student, and in life.<br><br>
              This isn't high school anymore where you take four classes in a day, maybe three if you have a spare. You can be taking upwards of maybe five or six courses at once, and if they all
              have midterms in the same week, or even in the same <i>day</i>, then you better learn how to manage your time wisely.<br><br>
              I remember I used to play Steam games (CS:GO for life) like crazy in high school. Once university hit, I completely had to change my habits because for me, setting into university life was
              hard. It's pretty dangerous getting good grades in high school without having to put in any effort, because those habits carry over.<br><br>
              If you have any bad habits, like sleeping at 4:00am constantly or playing games for hours and hours, break them immediately.</p>

        <div class="collapse" id="clubs">
          <br>
          <div class="card card-body">
            <strong>Joining Clubs</strong><br>
            <p class="coursetext">
              I know. You hear this a lot.<br><br>
              Speaking from personal experience though, joining clubs was a pretty big part of getting through university, especially if you're a new student. You get to meet a lot of new people, especially older
              ones that can give you their insight and knowledge. I made friends with this one student two years above me, and he gave me a lot of advice on what professors to avoid, gave me old midterms to study
              from, helped me with my labs, and more. Great way to meet people, who could end up providing a lot of relief in your stressful university life.<br><br>
              I get it, though. You don't know what clubs to join, or you're antisocial, or you can't find anything you're interested in. <i>And that's fine too</i>. You can always meet people other ways, this
              is just one example of it. Although, I find that as you just progress throughout the year, you'll naturally gravitate towards clubs you want to join. I know that when I was a first year student,
              I went to one CSHub event and now in third year, I'm the president of CSHub.</p>

          <br>
          <div class="card card-body">
            <strong>Making Friends</strong><br>
            <p class="coursetext">
              I'm just going to say right now - university is <strong>not</strong> a solo sport.<br><br>
              What does this mean? Go cheat on everything? No! It means to establish a good support group. You're bound to see the same people for the next 3-5 years, so you might as well get to know
              them, right? You're bound to study for the same midterms and exam, so might as well get to know them right?<br><br>
              I can definitely say, I would not be where I am right now without the support of all my friends and everyone I met in computer science. I remember one day walking out of a lecture hall having
              just written a midterm, and I was sitting on a bench waiting for my other friends to come out. I noticed the person sitting beside me had the same shoes as me, so I pointed it out and now he's
              one of my closest friends who has given me a ton of support through the last few years I've known him.<br><br>
              Make friends. If you're antisocial or in an awkward shell, it's time to get out of it. You're going to be a professional in a few years, it's important to know how to establish
              good relations with people, know to talk to one another, and how to make friends.<br><br>
              I'm going to say right now, your lectures and the computer science channel in the York University Discord server is a great way to start talking to people.</p>

          Hi there!<br><br>
          My name is Christopher, and I'm currently a third year Computer Science Honours student at Lassonde and I'm also the president of Computing Students' Hub (CSHub).<br><br>
          The reason I made this guide is because a lot of people (especially newer students) would reach out to me with a lot of the same questions so I wanted to put together this website
          as a way to answer all those common questions, as well as to document everything I've learned over the years and things I wish I knew when I was a first year student. I was really
          inspired when I saw seniors from other universities make guides like this, so I wanted to do the same and give back to the community.<br><br>
          If you're reading this, then thank you for taking the time to browse through my website. I hope it was of some assistance to you! If there are any inconsistencies, something outdated,
          or want a topic added, feel free to message me on Discord, @goosebreeder#8933.<br><br>
          All content is written by me. Special thanks to Jean, Jerry, and Lynn for helping me in the designing the layout of this website. &#10084;
